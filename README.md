# SensorLib test Manual

This manual specifies how to build, link with python and test SensorLib library
Tested platforms: cygwin 

## Required tools:

The following cygwin packets are required of the latest version available from cygwin distribution:
cmake*
gcc*
make*
python39
python39-pytest*
python39-sip
The following python packages are required to be installed through pip tool:
setuptools
wheel
The following additional tools are required:
MSVC VS 20xx C++ x64/86 build tools
Windows 10 SDK all packets
Paths to cygwin.dll and tools shall be added to PATH variable 

## How to build:

All steps are automated in build.sh script. Below is the list of steps to execute them manually.
1. From SensorLib\lib folder execute 
    cmake .
This will generate make environment
2. Execute
    make
This will build the target library libStateReporterLib.a
3. Rename or copy libStateReporterLib.a to libStateReporterLib.lib
    cp libStateReporterLib.a libStateReporterLib.lib
The following commands shall be executed from Sensorlib folder. They will build python interface around C library
4. sip-build --verbose
As a result build folder will be created
5. sip-install
As result  Sensorlibrary will be installed in python on the workstation and can be used from other python modules
in the form of 
import sensorlib

## Tests structure:

Test suite is located in test folder. 
Test vectors are stored in sensor_data.py in the sensor_data list.
Each test vector is the instance of SensorIdEntry dataclass
field listed in order of initialization: 
val - bytes string  - actual value to be set in the library in the string format
message_fileds - instance of TransmitFields class containing 
  func - function name
  desc - descriptor name
expected_result - enum value of Expected state, returned by the library
New test vector can be added by copying one of existing lines in the initialization of sensor_data and modifying corresponding values

## To run test suite:

1. Navigate to tests folder.
2. To run the complete test suite issue the following command.
python -m pytest test_ex1.py
3. To run specific test issue the following command
python -m pytest test_ex1.py -k '[sensor_entry<x>]'
where x is the number of desired entry in sensor_data list, starting from zero. 
-k pytest selector also allows to select other group of tests by matching between it's string parameter
and test name, generated by pytest.
